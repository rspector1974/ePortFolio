## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact I have included for the algorithms and data structures portion of my ePortfolio is from CS-260, data structures and algorithms. I created this example in the Spring of 2020. This program is written in C++ and demonstrates multiple data structures as well as the Binary Search Tree algorithm. The program presents the user with several options, the first loads data from a CSV file into a data structure, then loads that struct into nodes to create the binary search tree. The second option puts that data into a vector and iterates through the csv file outputting the information to the cli. The 3rd choice gives the user the ability to reference a single piece of information and retrieve that data from the struct. The software shows the efficiency of a binary search tree by counting the time it takes to search for the reference data. The 4th option allows the user to remove data from the struct and binary search tree.

I have included this in my ePortfolio as an example of my understanding of data structures and how algorithms can make software more efficient. The binary search tree&#39;s ability to narrow down search criteria makes it a very powerful tool for searching in a data set that has many different reference points, i.e., a binary search tree that branches. The data in the program is held in a data structure, that is multiple variables of different types that are referenced under the same name using the name.unique\_identifier\_structure. I can use this structure to organize data, a great example is shown in this software as it takes bid information in two data types, string and double and puts them in a data structure for easy reference. That coupled with the binary search tree shows a perfect example of how data structures and algorithms work together.

To enhance or improve this program I have added the ability for the user to search for a specific bid id. This is done via a prompt at the cli. I also gave the user the choice to output and input csv&#39;s of varying size to show how effective the binary search tree method is at returning queries. The program shows the amount of time it takes to both load the data structure and find the search item. By giving the user access to choose a different CSV file one can see the impact on search and load times based on the total number of records in the CSV file.

Finally, I think it is important to show my coding ability across different programming languages. Demonstrating my ability in C++ on both a syntax and conceptual level demonstrates my firm understanding of software development. It is all these aspects that make this an important addition to my ePortfolio.

I have met my initial course object that was developed in module one, adding a search feature to the programming. I extended my enhancement further by allowing the user to output all bids in the data structure, as well as input data from a file of their choice. Outputting all information from the CSV was done to give the user an idea of the total amount of records included in the import. The ability to specify files was added to quickly show the user the difference in search time between files of varying record quantities.

The point of this addition to my portfolio is to demonstrate my understanding of C++, data structures, algorithms and how these all work together to accomplish a task. Per module one, my enhancements do just that and I am happy with the outcome of the project.

During the process of enhancing and modifying my second artifact for CS-499, I refreshed my understanding of binary search trees, and how the nodes of the tree receive their assignments. I also was reminded of just how useful data structures in C++ are at organizing data and making that data available for reference in other methods and functions. This like much of coding in general required me to read up on syntax and remind myself of exactly how the program was intended to originally function. Once that was complete, I did not face any additional challenges during the modification process.
