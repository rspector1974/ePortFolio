**Introduction**
<hr>
I have included these three examples to show how the same basic goal can be accomplished using different methods. My understanding of PHP, Python, HTML, API&#39;s and CSS gave me the ability to develop customizations on these websites to suite the stake holders involved. The concepts and skills I have learned at SNHU through out my program have helped me to refine my code, make it more secure and deliver clearer more thought-out proposals to potentials clients and managers.

**Drupal Ecommerce Site**
[New England Art Exchange](http://www.newenglandartexchange.com)

This example is a project I did for New England Art Exchange 2 years ago. What prompted the project was the end of life of Drupal 7. While changing to Drupal 8 the owner decided he would like to implement an Ecommerce solution as well. The Ecommerce project required several custom SQL scripts to convert Drupal 7 content to Drupal Commerce Products. After the conversion and update were complete a PayPal payment gateway plugin was added and configured along with custom email notifications coded in their appropriate twig files. For security Google reCAPTCHA and Clean talk was implemented. Although not aesthetically flashy the amount of data stored on this website made for an interesting project when updating and adding new functionality.

**WordPress with WooCommerce**
[Foredom Electric Company](http://www.foredom.net)

This example was a complete redesign and implementation of a website that previously existing on a proprietary Network Solutions eCommerce platform. Photos and content were mostly available, but theme configuration, plugins and business operations integrations were built from scratch. I elected to use WordPress and WooCommerce as at the time it was the most cost effective and widely supported environment available. This project was started at the end of 2018 and finished in early summer of the same year. This website uses many anti-fraud measures as its traffic consists of over 10,000 unique visits per day. Part of the project was to integrate the WooCommerce transactions into the business&#39;s operations. This is done using plugins and integrations with the on-premise ERP system. A customer can place an order on the website and their data is transmitted directly to the production floor. All data is encrypted, and several anti-fraud measures are in place, including making use of a REST API that communicates customer information to a third party that then vett&#39;s the customer and guarantees the payment. After the new implementation of the WordPress platform sales have increased 25 percent.

**OpenCart**
[U-marq USA](http://www.u-marq.us)

The last example I have included to represent web development is built on the OpenCart platform, specifically version 3.0. OpenCart is a popular eCommerce platform in Europe. It was used for this project because the parent company at the time was based in the UK. This website was built from the ground up and integrated in UPS and FedEx for real time rates, as well as with Authorize.net for a payment gateway. Several custom twig files were created to facilitate order receipts and notifications. Tracking is available at the email level using UPS, FedEx and DHL&#39;s API&#39;s. This site uses reCAPTCHA 3.0 for its anti-spam methods. Custom CSS was developed to disable pricing on certain items and allow a dealer facing page based on login credentials assigned to certain customer types.
