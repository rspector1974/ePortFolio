**Professional Self-Assessment**

**Introduction**

The last two years spent at Southern New Hampshire University have been an incredibly positive experience for me! I started my education in computer science many years ago, and in 2018 decided it was time to finish the degree. I have been interested in computers, and IT since I was 10 years old and have always seen myself as someone who would be working in computer science or a related field. I am using this degree to further my knowledge in computer science and to prove to myself that I could successfully finish school. Now that I am at the end it is bittersweet but graduating with a perfect 4.0 is proof that no matter what your circumstances are in life (family, work, etc...) if you set your mind to something you can get it done!

Completing the coursework for the Computer Science program at SNHU has shown my ability to think logically, learn, and be successful in the field. On top of the core computer science program requirements, the curriculum at SNHU is designed to improve communication and get us thinking from different perspectives. This helps to ensure problems get looked at from all angles and teamwork thrives. The BS in comp sci has further reinforced my interest in all things &quot;tech&quot; and given me a new way to be creative about problem solving. I intend to use these newfound skills to leverage a higher-level position in business analytics, including ERP system implementation and production design.

This capstone course (CS-499) has showed me just how much I have learned through out this program. Aggregating all that information into this assessment, code review and software narratives demonstrates only a fraction of the knowledge that I have attained during my time at Southern New Hampshire University. I hope the final project for the class (this ePortfolio) also shows my communication skills and professional demeanor as I search for a job in the Computer Science field.

**Collaborating in a team environment**

Southern New Hampshire University&#39;s computer science program places a strong emphasis on team environments and collaboration. As comp sci students we have been introduced and trained in the Agile Methodology SLDC and given examples of collaboration tools like Bit Bucket and GitHub to facilitate teamwork. A very important aspect of team collaboration is being able to communicate with other team members and provide feed back on group work. CS-310 &quot;Collaboration and Team Project&quot; walked us through making changes to code, (in this case java) as a team via GitHub. Learning how to commit and annotate code to the team&#39;s standard ensures accurate communication, very important when working on complex projects. What may be even more important is knowing how to develop a culture that is productive and welcoming. CS-310 spent half of the course showing us how to speak to people of different cultures and backgrounds. After my classes at SNHU I am confident that I would be a great additional to any collaborative team software project.

**Communicating to stakeholders**

Another important and necessary skill of a computer science or IT professional is their ability to communicate with decision makers. Understanding things like code, security and networking are all a given, but with out the skills required to communicate with stakeholders getting projects accomplish is almost impossible. The class IT-201 Computer Platform Technologies&#39; focus was reporting and developing proposals that were to be approved by the stake holders. The course brought me through an entire requirements definition, deliverable schedule, and comparable analysis to ensure that the solution presented would not only work but be supportable, efficient, and cost effective. Some of the tool used in IT-201 included the Microsoft suite of products including Visio, Excel, and Word to prepare our documents. Communicating clearly and effectively with decision makers is what drives the computer science profession. After all, if you cannot convince the end users that your solutions will present an ROI or positive impact your work will not be considered necessary.

**Data structures and Algorithms**

Data structures and Algorithms are the building blocks of computer programing. Using data structures to hold and organize data makes the retrieval of that data more efficient, whether passing it to other methods or functions, or outputting directly. Algorithms are the way that data is used, from loops to searches. CS-260 Algorithms and Data Structures gave me the skills required to understand data structures and how Algorithms can use said data structures from a fundamental and practical standpoint. As you will see in my Data Structures and Algorithms code example, I have a strong understanding of how the two can work together. My example includes loading a C++ struct into a Binary Search Tree Algorithm and tracking the time it takes to search the data. A solid education in these components is required to successfully build efficient and error free code.

**Software engineering**

Software engineering to me is about the usability of a given piece of code or software. Creating solutions with code in a way that the user experience does not suffer is one of my primary goals when creating any software. IT-145 Foundations in Application Development is a java programming class taken early in the computer science program at SNHU. The project for this class includes software that authenticates access a Zoo System via username and password. I have reengineered this software from a command line driven utility to a graphical user interface, providing a more user-friendly experience. The skills I have learned in this program gave me what I needed use the Jframe libraries, learn a new syntax and complete my project. Software engineering is a very broad topic, it is impossible to know every aspect of all the available libraries, languages, and APIs available. SNHU&#39;s computer science program has taught me how to learn new tools and tricks and apply them to coding projects.

**Databases**

An education on databases, what they are, how to navigate them and how to manipulate them are an essential part of any computer science education. SNHU recognized this and provided me with several opportunities to explore data science. Coding for database work is very important, DAD-220 and CS-340 worked on the coding and development of both SQL and NoSQL (Mongo dB) databases. These classes brought together both the syntax required to manipulate databases including queries, and CRUD operations as well as best practices for securing database access and the querying of data efficient. DAT-220 showed me things about data mining that helped me to appreciate a logically put together database. Having been taught from both these perspectives gives me the ability to code for the user not for the developer. If the database is put together in a way that is not logical retrieving meaningful data for practical applications becomes more difficult.

**Security**

Security in Computer Science is something that cannot be emphasized enough in today&#39;s world of Ecommerce, Cloud hosting, and remote workers. Never has software been exposed to this many potential security risks. This makes security in coding and IT more important then ever. Southern New Hampshire University teaches many of their computer science course from a security perspective. For example, IT-140 taught me how to implement MD5 hash encryption for storing passwords and other sensitive data. IT-365 taught me how to secure processes when working with operating systems, ensuring that exception handling was done correctly to prevent stack overflow attacks. IT-340 provided the information required to not only secure a network but to also test it for potential vulnerabilities using Kali Linux. Once the vulnerabilities were identified, using patching and best firewall practices to eliminate the security risks were required of the curriculum.

Security must be looked at from all perspectives. IT-345 educated me on the importance of the principle of least access, identifying users as the largest security risk in any organization. That course also provided the tools required to determine proper permissions and implement training for employees that have access to the network.

From coding to networks and employee management. Southern New Hampshire University has given me the education required to operate a secure environment in modern computing. Starting with a secure foundation (coding) and creating a security plan for an organization that includes best employee practices is the only way to ensure a secure environment.

The artifacts I have chosen to showcase for my ePortfolio include aspects from Database development and manipulation, software engineering and design and data structures and Algorithms. These artifacts have been chosen in their specific categories to showcase my deep understand of computer science and some of the more popular components that make up the field. My ability to work in multiple programming languages is also shown in the examples I have put in my ePortfolio.

My database artifact is coded in Python, using various libraries to access a password protected database in a client server relationship. The client facing code is done using Plotly Dash to give the user several query and output options. This example shows my understanding of MongoDB (NoSQL) as well as my proficiency in Python. I have extended from the original project to allow more fine-grained querying of the database and show some of the more popular dash menu options available.

The example I chose to demonstrate my software engineering and design skills is coded in Java using several different classes. This software allows a user to log in, referencing a username and password to assign specific user permissions post authentication. The passwords are stored in an MD5 encrypted form to bolster the security of the program. I have extended the original project to use a graphical user interface rather than the original command line driven utility.

The final example I have included in my ePortfolio represents algorithms and data structures and is coded in C++. This program reads in data from a CSV file, storing the different data categories in a data structure. That data structure is then loaded into a binary search tree. The project shows the efficacy of a binary search algorithm by outputting the time taken to load and traverse the tree. I have extended the original assignment to allow the user to select a different csv file and to input the search criteria via the command line. The original code had both the csv file and search criteria hard coded. Extending the switch statement and added more error checking was required to extend this project.
